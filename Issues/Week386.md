Happy Thursday! It's that time of the year where everybody makes WWDC wishlists. I've already seen a lot of those, so I'm not actually going to link to any of them (sorry ðŸ˜…). Instead of wishes, let's talk about what we really know about this WWDC, and Apple helped by [publishing more details](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7/): the keynote is at 10 a.m PDT (7PM CEST), followed 4 hours later by the Platforms State of the Union. If this is your first WWDC, the keynote is the one with all the bells and whistles, but also all the press. It's the one that everybody watches. The Platforms State of the Union is the one that goes more in-depth on the new tools, APIs and changes that impact us, developers. And then, there are the sessions ("lecture"-style, one person presents to an audience) and the labs, which are again online (1-on-1 talks with Apple engineers). On top of those there are thechallenges, and newly introduced this year, the Pavilions. More details about this year's WWDC can be found on [the official website](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/).

Changing the subject.. since I'm basically writing to you every Thursday for almost 4 years now, I figured out it could be a good idea to let you know more about me, who I am, and how I started programming and doing iOS. In case you're curious about that, I had a lovely chat with [Filip Nemecek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f), which you can [read here](https://nemecek.be/chats/marius-constantinescu). Thanks for having me, Filip!

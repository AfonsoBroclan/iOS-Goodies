Happy Thursday! iOS 15 has been officially launched, and [I guess the adoption rate will be slower than we're used to](https://twitter.com/marius_const/status/1440242669179965450). However, iOS 15 as been a great update on my iPhone 11, everything runs smoothly and I think it's one of the most poslished iOS updates I've seen et. Great job everyone who worked on it üëè. Go update your devices so we can use async/await sooner üòÖ.

Together with iOS 15, Xcode 13 and [Swift 5.5 have been released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-5-released/). For Xcode 13, it seems it's the same build as the Releae Candidate from last week. And if you're curious to hear what's new in Swift 5.5, check out Paul's playground which I linked to in the Tools section below.

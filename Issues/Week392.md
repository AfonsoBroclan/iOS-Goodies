Happy Thursday! I've read [Chris Eidhof](http://www.twitter.com/chriseidhof/)'s article (featured below) on how they got rid of most of their dependencies and that reasonated with me. I'm not a fan of reinventing the wheel. But I've discovered about myself that in the recent years, I'm much more reluctant to include 3rd party dependencies in my projects than I was 5-6 years ago. It could be because Apple has improved their own iOS libraries, methods and capabilities, so a 3rd party library doesn't have that big of an advantage over just using the pure API. Or it could be because I've seen many cases where 3rd prty libraries are unmaintained and stop building on new versions of Xcode / Swift. Or it could be something else, I don't know. I'm curious, how many external dependencies do your projects usually have?

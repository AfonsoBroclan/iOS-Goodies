Happy Thursday! Apple announced the highly anticipated, new iPhone SE this week, and I think it's a very nice and affordable option to get a new iPhone :). Users may be sad that the 4-inch screen is deprecated now, but as developers, we can probably find some joy in that ðŸ˜…. I really wish they went with another name though, instead of reusing the name of a 4-year-old device; I hoped the iPhone naming schemes would be [clearer than the iPad one](https://twitter.com/marius_const/status/1243086151449284608).

In other news, if you're feeling down (due to the whole global situation that I don't want to talk about in this newsletter, just to keep the appearance that things are normal), I found [Jordan Morgan's](https://www.twitter.com/jordanmorgan10) article, [It's okay to do nothing](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/its-okay-to-do-nothing/), very comforting to read. Hope everyone is also taking care of themselves, besides taking care of others by not going out.

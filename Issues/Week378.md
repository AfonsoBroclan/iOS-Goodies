Happy Thursday! This year's [WWDC dates have officialy been anounced](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/): 7-11 June, and it's going to be fully online, like last year. We don't know much else so far, but I really love the way they used the [Craig Federighi meme](https://youtu.be/DOVBLweiz64?t=19) in this year's visuals. As always, people are trying to look for clues in the announcement, and everybody's freaking out because the persons in the visuals wear glasses. However I don't remember the WWDC announcement visuals ever having hinted towards what was going to be reveiled at the event. Remember the [WWDC 2018 white 3D visuals](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-4-in-san-jose/)? I don't see any of today's apps looking like that ðŸ˜„. Of course, I could be wrong and all the AR glass fans could get what they want this June. But if I were Apple and I were working on AR glasses, I would totally have a separate special keynote for them, instead of cramming their announcement together with "What's new in Swift" and "Core Location best practices".

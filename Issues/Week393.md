Happy Thursday! We finally got the Beta 3 of Xcode 13 that everyone was expecting last week or even the week before. And I also found this [12 hour course from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/) for learning the basics of Xcode, SwiftUI and UIKit, which, as far as I can tell, is new, even though I haven't seen it advertised as new by Apple. But then again, I haven't seen it advertised at all by Apple ðŸ˜…. Still, a very good resource if you want to start learning how to make iOS apps.

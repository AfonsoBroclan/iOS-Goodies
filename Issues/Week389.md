Happy Thursday! WWDC is over and there's so much stuff that was announcedGood thing is we have all summer for that. And I'm looking forward to curate articles from our community to get you up to speed with the latest tech. While we're on the WWDC subject, it could be useful to fill in the [WWDC21 Developer Survey](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=lb12ga2i). There's a question there about participating to these events in person or online ðŸ˜„. Now on to this weeks links!

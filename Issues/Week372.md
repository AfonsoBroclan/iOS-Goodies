Happy Thursday! I joined Clubhouse this week and I'm very intrigued by the app. The app's UI is a mix of very simple screens and [very nice animations](https://twitter.com/marius_const/status/1362122333817831426). But the idea of the app is the one that fascinates me the most. It's somewhere in between live podcasts and radio shows where you can call to enter live. Anyway, I'm writing this just to say that there's some very good content for iOS develoeprs there already: [@mecid](https://twitter.com/mecid) and [@marciyo94](https://twitter.com/marciyo94) have a [weekly show on iOS dev topics](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/xeLNV8QG) they've learned this week, there's an [Indie App Devs](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/mWNL6RN8) event right about now and earlier today [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) hosted a room where people could volunteer to answer iOS interview questions. If you have the time, there could be some very good content for iOS develoeprs in there. Now, regarding the not-so-positive, the app is iOS-only, it requires an invitation to join (don't mail me asking for one ðŸ™ˆ), it requests access to all your contacts in order to be able to invite a freind to the platform and there's a lot of room for improvement in terms of accessibility and inclusivity. Is it jut a fad? Time will tell. But for now, if you can get in and use the app, you might find some nice content in there.

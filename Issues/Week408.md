Happy Thursday! Xcode 13.2 just got its first beta yesterday, and in it, the new concurrency model in Swift has [been ported all the way back to iOS 13](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1453429350272053251). iOS 13 is the first version that supports SwiftUI and Combine, so just imagine how much more fun writing iOS apps just became. This is still in its first beta, and [as Doug Gregor mentions](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1453432581622362112), it's an enormously complicated feature to back deploy so there may be issues that the Swift team hasn't found yet. If you try it, make sure to submit a feedback if anything doesn't work as expected.

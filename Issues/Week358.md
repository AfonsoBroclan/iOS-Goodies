Happy Thursday! According to the [Mixpanel's reports](https://mixpanel.com/trends/#report/ios_14), there are now more devices running iOS 14 than iOS 13. It is a slower adoption than for iOS 13 or iOS 12, and it is a bit different than the data I am seeing from our apps, where iOS 14 is at around 38% and iOS 13 at around 56%. The differences are normal and expected, due to the difference in the amount of data and the markets where our apps are used. As iOS developers, of course, we would want all the users to be on the latest iOS version, that would allow us to drop support of old versions and it would enable us to use the latest APIs. So far, for me, iOS 14 has been very stable and I'm happy I updated my phone üòÅ

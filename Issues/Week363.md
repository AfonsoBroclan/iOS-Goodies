Happy Thursday! We only have a few more days until [the privacy questions on App Store Connect become mandatory](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=em8fm29e) on 8 December. And the submissions for the App Store Small Business Program (which we mentioned [2 weeks ago](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp)) [are now open](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp). If you enter before December 18, you can get the benefits from January 1st 2021.

I had been using [xcodereleases.com](https://xcodereleases.com/) to keep track of the Xcode releases, but I had always found it tricky to figure out which Swift version is used by which Xcode. Well now, with [Swift Version](https://swiftversion.net/) from [James Dempsey](https://www.twitter.com/jamesdempsey) it looks like I won't have that problem anymore.

Happy Thursday! Something completely unexpected happened yesterday: Apple announced the [App Store Small Business Program](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/), which means that developers making less than $1 million can have their commission reduced from 30% to 15%. This is great news for indie and small business, and something I was totally not expecting to happen ðŸ˜…. The full details will be released in December. This is a great move by Apple, who still keeps the 30% commission on the [approximately 2% of the developers who generate 95% of their revenue](https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1329025297082150912). However, that aspect is less important. What matters is that for the rest of 98% of the developers this will be a pretty big difference. They'll get a [revenue increase of around 20%](https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/1329021493813145601), which in many cases will allow developers who make this their goal [to go full indie sooner](https://twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1329099299175600136). And as Apple says in their press release, small businesses are the beating heart of innovation and opportunity. It looks like Apple started to get back some of the goodwill they've been losing recently over many App Store scandals or os releases with one day notice ðŸ˜„

Happy Thursday! I'm really looking forawrd to WWDC. But not necessarily to learn about and play with all the new APIs (although that's nice, too). Most of the projects out there still support iOS 13, many maybe go down to iOS 12 or even older, so for a lot of developers it's going to be years until they get to work with whatever Apple will showcase this summer. I'm excited for the WWDC week for all the enthusiasm that spreads across our community. For that thirst for knowledge that most of us have. Even for that silly desire to be the first one to tweet about something that we all saw live on the stream, or cover the keynote hours after it's finished (üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôà) or write an article about a particular topic that was announced 2 hours earlier. 

With WWDC being online for the second consecutive year, there are again initiatives from the community to turn this week into a global get-together where one can interact with other fellow developers and discuss the latest news from Apple. Based on the success of last year's WWDC Watch Party, [Michie](https://twitter.com/michieriffic) is putting together a very ambitious [WWDC Community Week](https://wwdc.community/). Things are still under construction but there's a list of plans and ideas on the website and it sounds amazing. The best way to support this initiative for now is, I suppose, sign up and get a ticket üòÑ

_Whats's this? Is this a new category? Maybe it is, maybe it's not. The main reason I added it this week is because I have this tweet which I really wanted to include, but I didn't want to add it to the initial comment as it felt a bit out of place there._

What does the Internet do with [the ads that Signal wanted to post on Instagram, but couldn't because they were banned](https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/)? Turn them into a meme, of course. What does an Apple developer with a sense of humor do with them? [THIS](https://twitter.com/icanzilb/status/1389952573256437762) üòÇ.

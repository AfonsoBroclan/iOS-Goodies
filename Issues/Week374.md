Happy Thursday! I haven't been on Twitter much these weeks, as I'm enjoying my parent leave (reminder to take it if you have it, or, why not, ask for it if you don't). We are getting around the time of year when Apple used to announce the dates for WWDC. Of course, last year was different, and I'm very curious to see how this year's WWDC will be. My current guess is that this year's WWDC will be more like the one last year and less like the ones before, in terms of logistics. And if we ever go back to in-person WWDC, they will most likely still be very different from the ones in 2019 and before that. Anyway, I'm excited ðŸ˜„

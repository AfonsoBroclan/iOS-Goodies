Happy Thursday! This week, when I looked over the available updates for the apps on my iPhone, I noticed one that didn't seem familiar: Apple Developer, with an icon that looks like Xcode without the hammer. I looked over the release notes, trying to figure out which app was that and all they read was "Thank you for your feedback" and a list of new features. Yet, I was sure I didn't have that app before. So I figured out it's a re-branding of something, and was curious to find oout of what. So I digged in more into the version history of the app. Almost 10 versions ago, I could finally read "We've made several changes to the WWDC app". So yes, the [WWDC app was rebranded into an Apple Developer app](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11182019a). It seemed a bit weird that the release notes didn't say anything about the rebranding of the app. So, what's new in the WWDC app? Honestly, not much, yet. A new tab, "Discover", mostly with links to sessions from the previous WWDC or news from Apple's developer program, and the possibility for developers from U.S. to enroll into Apple's developer programme. But let's hope there will be more to the new app than this :).

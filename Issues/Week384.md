Hapy Thursday! I've seen [this tweet](https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1392703495996944389) saying that Swift has been around for more than half of iOS development and I was amazed by that. I started my iOS dev journey in the Objective-C days. I even remember writing some `retain` and `release` back when I started, even though I probably wasn't very sure how that worked back then. All that seems so long ago. However, Swift somehow almost still feels like "that new thing" to me, when that's clearly not the case anymore. I remember in 2014 when it was announced that I realised immediately this was something big. I just didn't realise how big it would be. I'm looking forward to this WWDC. I don't expect anything big or revolutionary, but I also wasn't expecting that in 2014 when Swift was announced or in 2019 when SwiftUI and Combine were announced. I don't want to get your hopes up and I really don't have any inside information ðŸ˜‚. I'm just excited for WWDC 2021 ðŸ˜„.

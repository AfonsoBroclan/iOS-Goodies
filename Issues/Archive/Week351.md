Happy Thursday! Apple announced a [special event on September 15](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) and the rumours can't agree if it's an iPhone event like all the other early September events from the previous years or if it's an iPad and Apple Watch only event. I guess we'll find out next week. There's till no sign of the Xcode 12 GM so far, the latest release is Beta 6, even though iOS has reached Beta 8. Even more reasons to look forward to next week, right? üòÅ

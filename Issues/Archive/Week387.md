Happy Thursday! Last edition before WWDC 2021 ðŸ˜Š. As opposed to the last two years, I'm not going to send out the special WWDC edition hours after the keynote and Platforms State of the Union have ended. I did enjoy doing that the last two years but the timezones really don't work in my favor and I would rather focus more on making sure the info I send to you is top quality than on sending it as soon as possible.

As WWDC is getting nearer, I have added a new section to the newsletter, which covers articles about Apple's conference. Hope you enjoy the links in this edition! See you on the other side ðŸ˜„

Happy Thursday! What a week, huh? Most conferences and major events are getting cancelled, a lot of countries (the one where I reside too) are imposing restrictions meant to slow down the coronavirus outbreak and a lot of companies and people are working from home for the first time and they're not used to this. This week's Business/Career section contains a few articles meant to give some tips on working from home. If working remotely is something you were curious to try, and this is your first time, just be aware that this is not it. Normally, kids are in school/daycare, and it's your choice if you want to work from home, a cafe, a coworking space or other alternatives. This situation is different. And each of your fresh remote colleagues has their own special situation at home, with which they have to deal. Be understanding of each other, support each other, have daily video calls, set up separate channels for sharing how you navigate this new experience, be reasonable in your expectations with yourself and with your colleagues. Wash your hands, stay home, stay safe!

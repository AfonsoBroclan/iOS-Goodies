Happy Thursday! I wrote last week that Xcode 13 Beta 3 was released, and indeed it was. Also, two days later, it was re-released. According to [@XcodeReleases](https://twitter.com/XcodeReleases/status/1416085354692497412) it seems it's mostly the same, but the re-release fixes something related to Xcode Could (for those who were lucky to get access to the beta ðŸ¥º).

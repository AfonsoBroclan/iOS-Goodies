Happy Thursday! This Saturday at 8 PM CEST (11 AM PDT) is a new edition of [iOS Dev Happy Hour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ios-dev-happy-hour-tickets-167263444465). My schedule didn't allow me to participate in any of those events yet, but they are a great opportunity to meet new iOS developers and share experiences. I would encourage everyone to try and join, no matter how experienced they are in iOS. Show up, be nice, make new friends, have fun ðŸ˜Š

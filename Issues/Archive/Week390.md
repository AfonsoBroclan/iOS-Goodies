Happy Thursday! We're getting now in the calmer period of the summer, a lot more quiet than the WWDC period in the beginning of the month. If you'd like a recap on WWDC, [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) wrote one: [WWDC21: Wrap up and recommended talks](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/239/wwdc21-wrap-up-and-recommended-talks). 

I've said it before and I'll say it again: in the next period, you'll see a lot of content about the newly announced things, async/await, SwiftUI's search bar, Xcode 13, etc. You are not missing out and you are not falling beind if you didn't have the time to look into any of these. That's tech that was announced 3 weeks ago, and it's something we won't be able to use until autumn (best case) or until many years from now. But new tech is interesting and fun to play with, so that's why content creators jump on it instantly.

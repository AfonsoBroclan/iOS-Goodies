Happy Thursday! A lot of updates from Apple since our edition last week. First of all, [Apple announced WWDC 2020](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/), and, as everyone expected, it's going to be an online event. Apple didn't really give many details, and we're still waiting for updates regarding the format or even the exact dates. Secondly, Apple released the GM version of iOS 13.4, which also includes mouse and trackpad support for iPadOS. Right on time for the new iPad Pro that was announced yesterday, right? So yes, iOS 13.4 GM is available, but still no Xcode 11.4 GM. Could it be because there's a simulator for unreleased hardware that we're not supposed to see yet? I guess we'll find out in the next few days.

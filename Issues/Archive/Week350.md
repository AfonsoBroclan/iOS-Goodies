Happy Thursday! We finally have [more details on the app privacy questions](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5), something Apple announced at WWDC in June. And another pretty big news from Apple is that later this year they will introduce [subscriptions offer codes](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=lrnyc3aj). Apart from that, iOS 13.7 was released together with the Xcode 11.7 GM. Don't confuse this with the Xcode 12 GM, which wasn't announced yet at the time I'm writing this. However, we got the iOS 14 Beta 7, but no Xcode 12 Beta 7 or GM yet.

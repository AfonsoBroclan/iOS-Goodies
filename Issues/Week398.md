Happy Thursday! SharePlay, the first new feature announced in the WWDC Keynote, [has been postponed](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mxaeu6er) and won't make it to the first final release. I personally hadn't heard of issues with SharePlay that would require it to be skipped from the first release, but I'm glad Apple is taking the time to polish it before releasing. 

**Tips from Twitter**

* [Build credibility on the internet](https://twitter.com/hybridcattt/status/1427954707067195393): very good suggestions in Marina's thread about building an audience and making a name for yourself
* [Xcode/Swift support matrix](https://twitter.com/gregheo/status/1425906037622591488): if you, like me, often lose track of which Swift is supported by which Xcode and what iOS version can you build for using those, then make sure to bookmark Greg's tweet and the link inside.
* [Ensure your app stays accessible](https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10/status/1428423981258919941): there's more to accessibility than Voice Over and Dynamic Type. Jordan shows how to make your app react to the "Reduce Transparency" setting.

For some weird reason, whenever I hear "async await", I think of [The Lion Sleeps Tonight](https://twitter.com/marius_const/status/1322237944388866049) song. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one.
